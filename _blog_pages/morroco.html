<p>Arguably one of the most beautiful countries in the world, blessed with a very unique location <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5986&amp;awinaffid=335377&amp;clickref=&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FTourism-g293730-Morocco-Vacations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Morocco</a> is one of the very few countries in the world where you can basically experience all the diverse geographical features and climates, not to mention the extremely rich cultural treasures you can get to find there. In this piece we would like to represent you to this beautiful, alone-standing country that&rsquo;s called Maghreb by the Muslim-Arabic world.</p>
<p><img class="img-fluid" src="//gst.gosearchtravel.com/posts/September2018/main.jpg" /></p>
<p>Many people think that <a title="Morocco" href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5986&amp;awinaffid=335377&amp;clickref=&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FTourism-g293730-Morocco-Vacations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morocco</a> is just as Arabic as other Northern African countries, but the fact of the matter is, that the country already had a high number of the so-called Berber native tribes along with their own culture by the time of the first Moorish-Arabic conquests back in the 9th century. The assimilation of the tribes didn&rsquo;t go as successfully as in the case of other nations. In fact to this day, most of the Atlas, Rifi and Amazigh tribes have managed to keep their cultural identity as well as their own language. This is why the country is a melting pot of different cultures. Not many people know that Morocco also has a substantial Jewish heritage. Among the modern conquests many nations have left their mark and their cultural effects on Morocco, especially the French and the Spanish in the Northern regions.</p>

<h3>Essaouira (known as Mogador in the colonial times)</h3>

As it only takes about 40-45 minutes to get here from Marrakesh it&rsquo;s also a centre of tourism and this is also where locals go if they want to take a dip in the ocean or just watch it. The town is therefore packed with villas, it has a nice little old village centre and an old bastion.</p>

Especially because the little village of Moulay Idriss, that&rsquo;s greatly important in the Moroccan Islamic culture is also located nearby.

<h2>Expert Advice on visiting Morocco:</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>
<p><strong>Do not visit during the Holy Month of Ramadan:</strong> this encompasses 30 days of fasting. Most stores and touristic sites work with limited opening times and people do not eat or drink during the day. Out of respect, it&rsquo;s best not to visit in this period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get a local guide:</strong> it&rsquo;s not expensive but definitely very useful. They would also keep away all the rip-off artists and scammers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be aware:</strong> that you will have difficulties when it comes to paying with credit or bank cards. You will also need to find a good place to exchange money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay in a Riad as this is the closest form of experiencing Moroccan hospitality and the Moroccan way of life including homemade food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dress and act modestly, respect the local culture.</p>
</li>
