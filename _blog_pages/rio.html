<p>When it comes to ranking of the cities according to the most beautiful location, there is no way Rio de Janeiro is not enlisted among the finalists. Having some of the most exceptional beaches paired up with a mild tropical climate Rio arguably looks like paradise on Earth. The city hosted two large sports events recently, namely the Olympic Games and the World Cup which made it even more popular and also which helped the city undergo plenty of renovation too. These also opened lots of possibilities for the city to become a safer place. This time around, I would like to introduce you to this wonderful and colourful city, Rio de Janeiro, which is the largest and most popular city in Brazil.</p>

<p>Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565 by the Portuguese conquerors of the land and it first served a fort city to protect the land. It&rsquo;s a little-known fact that when France invaded Portugal the Portuguese Royal Family moved to Brazil and made Rio de Janeiro the capital of Portugal. Boasting a very unique geographical situation, the huge city of Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city of Brazil, with only Sao Paolo being bigger. The city used to be the capital until the 1960s when it was relocated to newly-built Brasilia. The city consists of the following key districts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centro:</strong> this is where some of the most beautiful parts of the city are located, including the Santa Teresa old town, here is also where you can find the business centre of the city. Top attractions in this zone include the Municipal Theatre, the National Museum of Fine Arts, he Tiradentes Palace and the large Metropolitan Cathedral.</li>
<li><strong>Zona Sul:</strong> The South side of the city is the most famous as this is the place where you can get to find the world-famous Copacabana and Ipanema beaches and the large majority of the hotels. It is from here you can travel up to visit the huge Christ Sculpture and the Sugarloaf Mountain too.</li>
<li><strong>Zona Norte:</strong> This zone has become world famous for the fans of sports as it&rsquo;s the zone of the huge Maracana Stadium. Also, here you will find the large City Zoo, the National Museum and the beautiful Quinta da Boa Vista Park.</li>
<li><strong>Zona Oeste:</strong> it&rsquo;s the newest part of the city, this is where you can find the Barra da Tijuca which is a very popular beach for surfers. It&rsquo;s also here you can get to find the Olympic venues too.</li>

<h2>Culture and history:</h2>
<p>Rio de Janeiro just like the whole of Brazil is shaped by all those inhabitants, whose ancestors arrived here either as immigrants, from all across Europe or as slaves from Africa. This eclectic mix of people, alongside the indigenous inhabitants had come to create one of the most colourful races and cultures in the world. Rio is real dance and music capital, where there are parties every night especially during the summertime.</p>
</div>
<div class="block probootstrap-animate">
<h2>Religion and people:</h2>
<p>The large majority of people in Rio de Janeiro are Roman Catholic and religion is taken pretty seriously here, it&rsquo;s still a part of the general lifestyle. As a gift of that, Rio is full of lovely churches, some specifically for the white and some specifically for the African-Brazilian citizens and some for everyone.</p>

<h2>The top attractions to see in Rio de Janeiro</h2>
<p>Rio is colourful and chaotic at the same time, there is always something to do and to see here, but let me represent you to some of the best and most beautiful places you shouldn&rsquo;t miss when in Rio.</p>
</div>
<div class="block probootstrap-animate">
<h3><a href="#" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Copacabana beach</a></h3>
<p>Of course, when in Rio, there is no way you wouldn&rsquo;t go to its top beach, the Copacabana which is unfortunately so incredibly packed with people that it would soon inspire you to look for other beaches, which are less touristic. Nonetheless not even the crowd can take away the beauty and the fantastic location of this 4 km long city beach. Copacabana is located in the very downtown, here is where you can find the best bars, restaurants and hotels too.</p>

</div>
<div class="block probootstrap-animate">
<h3><a href="#" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ipanema beach</a></h3>
<p>Being almost as famous as the Copacabana, Ipanema is the other great city beach of Rio, basically a continuation of the Copacabana, leading you to a more artistic and avant-garde neighbourhood which is also packed with restaurants, art galleries and it also has a very popular antique flea market which is held here every Sunday. Sunday also gives way to the Feira de Artesanato de Ipanema, an arts celebration, which is held here every Sunday.</p>

</div>
<div class="block probootstrap-animate">
<h3><a href="#" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit Christ the Redeemer </a></h3>
<p>A signature attraction that&rsquo;s also the symbol of the city, the giant Christ statute, situated on the Corcovado, overlooking the whole city, would not only give visitors a spiritual boost, it also offers some of the most spectacular views to the whole of the city. The mountain is an integral part of the Tijuca National Park which is a protected natural area. The statue was built between 1922 and 1931 and in its Art Deco and was done by Paul Landowski, a French-Polish sculptor. The giant sculpture is 30 metres tall and weighs a whopping 635 tons. Not many people know, that the huge sculpture also gives home to a chapel and lots of weddings and baptism take place here. You can come up here with the Corcovado Rack Railway that starts up at the Rua do Cosme Velho and those who are braver can also go up there using a cable car. There are plenty of guided tours, some starting early in the morning, to avoid big crowds. I suggest everyone to take the tour to learn more about the statue, the culture of the city and its history. The place is also an important part of Catholic pilgrimage tours.</p>

<h3><a href="#" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travel up to the Sugarloaf Mountain</a></h3>
<p>The landmark cliff of Rio de Janeiro got its name thanks to its shape which resembles a natural sugarloaf, not to mention the fact that Brazil is famous for its huge sugarcane industry. Sugarloaf is 394 metres high. The best way to visit is by cable car, which starts from the Praca General Tiburcio going up to Morro da Urca and take a second cable car from there to reach the top. This excursion would also make you learn more about the city and its history especially if you visit the nearby lying Fort Sao Joao which was built by the Portuguese conquerors in the 16th century.</p>

Founded as early as 1808 this is not an ordinary park, as it&rsquo;s an UNESCO biosphere reserve and it also contains tons of beautiful sites, such as the Japanese Gardens or the lovely Orchidarium located in an antique greenhouse that was built back in the 1930s. In addition, the park is packed with beautiful species of parrots, hummingbirds and other birds which you can otherwise only see in cages or in the zoo.

<p>Apart from the lovely old tram which you ought to try, Rio has a well-developed Metro system and a huge bus system which mean the cheapest ways of transport.</p>
<p>Most tourists are advised to take cabs to avoid getting lost. The normal cabs are yellow, the cheapest and more trusted Radio taxis can be white, green or blue, and their price is fixed. Special service cars are often organized by hotels or program organizers and these are not labelled as taxis. Always negotiate the price before taking one of these. If you want to keep a low budget, you can ride the local buses which generally go every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>If you want to use public transport, get a RioCard to save you time and money. Be aware that there are so many lines going in so many directions that it may be more complicated to go by bus than going with a taxi. Both the metro and bus lines are easy to find online. Another good alternate is to rent a bike, through a well-known system that&rsquo;s called Bike Rio. Walking is another great option.</p>
