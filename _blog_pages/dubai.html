<p>These days when it comes to visiting any Middle Eastern cities, then Dubai is definitely among the top destinations to choose. There are many reasons for that. First of all it&rsquo;s one of the very few places, where tourists can freely visit, regardless of religious or cultural beliefs, second of all, the whole region has really grown out to become a fantastic tourist destination. With countless sites and programs on offer, the metropolis is not just an international business hub, it&rsquo;s also one of the most family friendly places in the world, and there is literally nothing you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to shop in Dubai. Getting there: the easiest way to get to Dubai is by air and its prominent airline the Emirates is flying to and from a great deal of destinations.</p>

<p>Dubai is part of the United Arab Emirates which consists of 7 different emirates. Contrary to the beliefs it is not the capital city of the UAE, because that&rsquo;s neighbouring <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5986&awinaffid=335377&clickref=&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FTourism-g294013-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi-Vacations.html" target="_blank">Abu Dhabi</a>, which is another great destination that has started a huge growth in the past few years. Dubai is a real melting pot because people from all continents and all countries are welcome to live and work there. Besides being a Muslim country, there is a great acceptance of every people and religion given that everyone gives respect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" target="_blank">Islam</a>, meaning not consuming alcohol out on the street and dressing more or less modestly everywhere. Despite many people believing that the metropolis can thank its dynamic improvement to oil, this doesn&rsquo;t really cover the truth. The primary reason for Dubai&rsquo;s growth could be oil but for many years now, it&rsquo;s the tourism and business that has become the primary sources of income for the metropolis. In fact Dubai hosts several international events, which makes tons of celebrities visit there rather frequently. Most of the modest and Muslim bloggers visit Dubai yearly, especially for the <a href="https://www.dubaimodestfashionweek.com/en/">yearly Modest Fashion Week</a> event that gives Middle Eastern and Muslim designers from all over the world the chance to feature their collections on a huge platform. Dubai is also a centre of jewellery and diamond trade.</p>
<p>Best season to visit: although there is non-stop air conditioning going on in every hotel and shopping centre the heat of the summer may be just too much for most of us. The best seasons to visit therefore include springtime, winter and autumn.</p>

<p>Dubai, being an ultramodern city is in lack of natural seaside promenades where you can enjoy a great deal of caf&eacute;s, sweets and the sight of water.

The locals living in Dubai do their best to preserve the Middle Eastern culture.</p>

<h2>Sports:</h2>
<p>Dubai is also a sports center and it&rsquo;s a real haven for those being fan of watersports and golf especially.</p>
</div>
<div class="block probootstrap-animate">
<h2>Commuting:</h2>
<p>Dubai is served by its own Metro line and it also has various bus lines. Most people however take taxi or rent a car when they are in Dubai.</p>
</div>
<p>Dubai as wonderful as it is definitely for those who can afford it. It&rsquo;s an expensive place therefore it&rsquo;s not for everyone&rsquo;s budget. Before travelling to Dubai, check with the nearest consulate if you need to obtain a tourist visa or not.</p>
